# Age Checker Program
## Description:
This program prompts the user to enter their age and then checks if the age is between 12 and 50 (inclusive). If the age falls within this range, it prints "young"; otherwise, it prints "not young".

## Code Overview:
### The program consists of two main parts:
  -  The CheckAge function, which takes an integer age as input and prints "young" or "not young" based on the age.
  -   The main function, which prompts the user for their age, calls the CheckAge function with the input age, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
